## How to start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

## Syntax

`{submitted && <h1>You have created a new account!</h1>}`
Think of the `&&` operator as controlling the return value of the expression.

When the expression on the left-hand side of `&&` evaluates to `true`, the value of the expression on the right-hand side (RHS) is returned.

When the expression on the left-hand side of `&&` evaluates to `false`, the value of the expression on the left-hand side (LHS) is returned, and the evaluation of the expression stops there due to short-circuiting.

### `npm start`
